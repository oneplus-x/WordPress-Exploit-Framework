To ensure a pleasant experience for all contributors, [Tyler Durden](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0137523/characters/nm0000093) has put together a code of conduct which everyone is asked to follow:

* Rule 1: You do not talk about Fight Club.
* Rule 2: You **DO NOT** talk about Fight Club.
* Rule 3: Don't break the code

Thank you
